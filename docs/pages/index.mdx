# Introduction
 
Welcome to Cart! ðŸ›’ An Open Source Headless cart management library that does all the heavy lifting of managing the cart state, storing them in local storage, and even more.


## What is Cart?


An online shopping cart is like a virtual basket for your online purchases. It helps you add items, review them, and make payments easily. However, building one from scratch can be tough and time-consuming. It requires a lot of coding and might have more bugs or security issues.


## Example

> Please note that the cart library is a headless, means only the cart functions will be provided. No UI, No styles. Below one I created the UI for demo purpose. You can test using the below example.

import {MyCart} from "../components/mycart.tsx"

<MyCart />
